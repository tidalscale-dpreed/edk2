/**
  Called at the early stage of the Boot phase to know if the memory has already been initialized

  Running the code from the reset vector does not mean we start from cold boot. In some case, we
  can go through this code with the memory already initialized.
  Because this function is called at the early stage, the implementation must not use the stack.
  Its implementation must probably done in assembly to ensure this requirement.

  @return   Return the condition value into the 'Z' flag
